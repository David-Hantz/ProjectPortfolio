#Bakery Sales Data Analysis

I used the pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries for this project.

This project is an exploratory analysis of bakery sales data, showcasing data cleaning, transformation, and visualization skills in Python. My goal for this analysis is to understand product performance, customer purchase patterns, and sales distribution over time.
I wanted to clean the dataset for analysis by reducing the number of products and fixing inconsistencies.
After cleaning, I explored various sales metrics, such as top-selling and underperforming items, transaction averages, and sales trends.
Post-exploration, I used visualizations to communicate insights of sales distributions by item, time of day, and hour.

Data cleaning: I chose to reduce the product list to 18 key items. Dropped duplicate entries, adjusted data types, and renamed two columns for consistency.

Analysis: I plotted sales data to further understand the overall sales distribution.
Then, decided to calculate and analyze the average number of items purchased per transaction.
I visualized the top-ten most sold items and the bottom 5 worst-performing items.
A heatmap was chosen to show the sales distribution across items and times of the day.
Then further visualized sales distribution by hour to identify peak sales times.

Insights: Highlighting both high-performing and low-performing items helps in decision-making for inventory and promotions.
Understanding peak sales hours and item popularity supports scheduling and stocking strategies.

Things to add: I would like to extend my analysis to seasonal sales trends. 
To improve targeting, I'd also like to incorporate customer segmentation.
